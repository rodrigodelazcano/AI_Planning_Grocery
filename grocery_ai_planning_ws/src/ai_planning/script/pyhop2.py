Pyhop 2, beta 3
This fixes a pretty big error in Pyhop 2, beta 2. It wasn't backtracking
properly, and none of the test files tested this. Beta 3 fixes that error,
and I've added a test file to illustrate how the backtracking should work.

Pyhop 2 is an enhanced version of Pyhop that can plan for both tasks and goals.
It requires Python 3. It isn't backward-compatible with Pyhop, but nearly is.
For an example, see the file pyhop1_simple_travel_example.py.

This file provides the following classes, functions, and variables. 
Use python's 'help' function to get information about each of them.

- classes and their methods: 
    Domain:    copy, display
    Multigoal: copy, display
    State:     copy, display

- functions:
    current_domain, set_current_domain, domains, remove_domain
    declare_actions
    declare_commands
    declare_goal_methods
    declare_multigoal_methods
    declare_task_methods
    find_plan
    get_type
    m_split_goals
    print_actions
    print_commands
    print_methods
    run_lazy_lookahead
    verify_goals

Accompanying this file are a README.md file that's an overview of Pyhop 2,
and several files to give examples of how to use Pyhop 2.
To run them, launch python and type one or more of the following:
import simple_tasks1
import simple_tasks2
import backtracking_tasks
import blocks_tasks
import simple_goals
import blocks_goals
import blocks_goal_splitting

# A built-in multigoal method and its helper function.


def m_split_goals(state,multigoal):
    """
    m_split_goals is the only multigoal method that Pyhop 2 provides, and
    Pyhop 2 won't use it unless the user declares it explicitly in a call
    to pyhop2.declare_multigoal_methods.
    
    m_split_goals takes two arguments: the current state and a multigoal
    to achieve. m_split_goals separates the multigoal into a collection of
    individual goals. Then it repeatedly iterates through the list of
    individual goals, trying to achieve each goal that isn't already true.
    The purpose of the repetition is to overcome deleted-condition
    interactions (in which accomplishing a goal has a side-effect of 
    falsifying another goal that was previously true).
    
    More specifically, if one or more of the individual goals is not true,
    then m_split_goals returns a goal list [g_1, ..., g_n, G], where
    g_1, ..., g_n are the goals that aren't true, and G is the multigoal.
    The list tells seek_plan to achieve g_1, ..., g_n sequentially, then
    invoke m_split_goals again to re-achieve any goals that have become
    false.

    The main problem with m_split_goals is that it isn't smart about
    choosing the order in which to achieve g1, ..., gn. Some orderings

# Applying actions and commands
#
# An action is applied only if the task name is the name of the action.
# This differs from HGN planners such as GDP and Godel, in which we can
# decide which actions are relevant by matching their "effects" atoms with
# the goal atoms. That isn't feasible in Pyhop 2.
#
# The problem is that in Pyhop 2, the only way to tell what effects an
# action will have is to try to apply the fully instantiated action.
# Thus, to find an action that is applicable in a state s and whose effects
# satisfy a goal g, we would need to iterate through every possible action
# instance (i.e, every combination of action name and parameter values), to
# see if applying the action instance in s produces a state that satisfies
# g. Such a combinatorial explosion would be unacceptably expensive.
#
# In Pyhop 2, one can get the same effect, with much less computational
# expense, as follows. Consider a blocks-world action unstack(hand,b1,b2)
# that has three effects: loc(b1)=hand, holding(hand)=b1, and
# the-block-on(b2)=nil. Then we can write three methods:
# - a method m1(b1,new_loc) that's declared relevant for 'loc'. If
#   called with new_loc = hand, it calls unstack(hand,b1,state.loc(b1)).
# - a method m2(hand,b1) that's declared relevant for 'holding'.
#   It calls unstack(hand,b1,state.loc(b1)).
# - a method m3(b2,status) that's declared relevant for 'clear'. If
#   called with status=nil, it calls unstack(hand,the-block-on(b2),b2)).
#
# In hgn_pyhop <https://github.com/ospur/hgn-pyhop>, unlike Pyhop 2, one
# may declare actions to be directly relevant for goals. I considered
# adding this feature to Pyhop 2, but decided against it. For a goal of the
# form g = (name, arg, val), it would require restricting each relevant
# action to have exactly two parameters, one corresponding to arg and the
# other corresponding to val. Suppose we try to do this with the action
# unstack(hand,b1,b2) described above. To make it relevant for the goal
# loc(b1)=hand, we would need to rewrite it to take two parameters:
# b1 and hand.  If we instead wanted to make it relevant for the goal
# holding(hand,b1), or the goal atop(b2,nil), we would need
# to rewrite the action so its parameters can be hand and b1, or
# b2 and nil, respectively. All three of these are a bit unnatural --
# and furthermore there's no way to accomplish all three of them at
# once, which is what the GDP and Godel HGN planning algorithms would
# require. In contrast, in the current Pyhop 2 we can easily get the
# same effect by writing the three goal_methods described earlier.
# In my view, this is a better approach.
